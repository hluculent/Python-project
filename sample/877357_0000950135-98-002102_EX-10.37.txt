                                                                    --- 
                               CONSULTING AGREEMENT 
        This Consulting Agreement ("AGREEMENT"), effective as of October 1, 1995, 
 is between SEPRACOR INC. ("SEPRACOR"), a Delaware corporation having its 
 principal office at 33 Locke Drive, Marlborough, Massachusetts 01752, and Digby 
 W. Barrios, 57 Main Street, Ridgefield, Connecticut 06877 ("CONSULTANT"). 
        WHEREAS, SEPRACOR wishes to engage the services of the CONSULTANT in the 
 area of business development ("FIELD"); and, 
        WHEREAS, the CONSULTANT wishes to provide consulting services to SEPRACOR 
 on the terms herewith set forth; 
        THEREFORE, SEPRACOR and CONSULTANT agree that: 
 1.     TERM 
        The term of this AGREEMENT shall be one year, commencing on October 1, 
 1995, however, it is automatically renewed, unless sooner terminated in 
 accordance with the provisions of Section 9. 
 2.     SERVICES 
        During the term of this AGREEMENT, CONSULTANT agrees to diligently and 
 conscientiously use his best efforts to discharge projects in the FIELD as may 
 be reasonably requested from time to time by SEPRACOR. Responsibilities of 
 CONSULTANT include providing such advice and information relating to the FIELD 
 as SEPRACOR may reasonably request from time to time, and communicating with 
 various third parties on behalf of SEPRACOR on matters relating to the FIELD. 
 During the term of this AGREEMENT, CONSULTANT shall not take part in any 
 activity in the FIELD which is a conflict of interest with his activities on 
 behalf of SEPRACOR, and he shall not assist any other person or organization 
 that competes, or intends to compete with SEPRACOR in this FIELD. 
 Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 2, nothing in this AGREEMENT 
 shall preclude CONSULTANT from providing consulting services to any other person 
 or entity for such projects which SEPRACOR and CONSULTANT have mutually agreed 
 are not within the FIELD. 
 
 
 3.     COMPENSATION 
        SEPRACOR shall pay CONSULTANT at the rate of $1,500 per month in 
 consideration for consulting services provided on behalf of SEPRACOR. SEPRACOR 
 shall also reimburse CONSULTANT for all travel, office and related expenses 
 reasonably incurred in connection with the performance of duties as a consultant 
 to SEPRACOR. 
        In a monthly invoice, CONSULTANT shall document the time spent and 
 expenses incurred in connection with providing consulting service to SEPRACOR. 
 SEPRACOR shall pay such invoice within thirty (30) days of its receipt. 
        The CONSULTANT shall not be entitled to any benefits, coverages, or 
 privileges, including, without limitation, social security, unemployment, 
 workers' compensation, medical or pension payments, or holiday/vacation pay or 
 other such benefits made available to employees of SEPRACOR. 
 4.     INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR 
        CONSULTANT shall be considered to be an independent contractor and not an 
 agent or employee of SEPRACOR and has no authority to bind SEPRACOR. 
 5.     RECORDS AND REPORTS 
        CONSULTANT agrees to keep records, in such form as the parties may agree, 
 to make reports in writing to SEPRACOR at SEPRACOR's reasonable request and to 
 deliver to SEPRACOR upon termination of the AGREEMENT or at any other time upon 
 request by SEPRACOR all records, files, memoranda, notes, designs, data, 
 reports, drawings, plans, software, software documentation, sketches, laboratory 
 and research notebooks and other documents (and all copies or reproduction of 
 such materials) relating to the business of SEPRACOR. Such written records shall 
 be available to and remain the sole property of SEPRACOR. 
 6.     REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTEES 
        CONSULTANT represents and warrants that CONSULTANT is free to enter into 
 this AGREEMENT and perform the consulting services provided for in this 
 AGREEMENT. CONSULTANT agrees that all information CONSULTANT discloses to 
 SEPRACOR shall be received by SEPRACOR without further obligation to CONSULTANT 
 than as provided herein. CONSULTANT also represents that, except as he has 
 disclosed in writing to SEPRACOR, he is not bound by the terms of any agreement 
 with any previous employer or other party to refrain from using or disclosing 
 any trade secret or confidential or proprietary information in the course of his 
 performance of services under this AGREEMENT or to refrain from competing, 
 
 
 directly or indirectly, with the business of such previous employer or any other 
 party. CONSULTANT further represents that his performance of all the terms of 
 this AGREEMENT does not and will not breach any agreement to keep in confidence 
 proprietary information, knowledge or data acquired by him in confidence or in 
 trust prior to the commencement of this AGREEMENT, and he will not disclose to 
 SEPRACOR or induce SEPRACOR to use any confidential or proprietary information 
 or material belonging to any previous employer or others. 
        If CONSULTANT is aware of circumstances under which SEPRACOR may not be 
 free to use CONSULTANT's information without liability of any kind, or the use 
 of which by SEPRACOR would result in a possible infringement of one or more 
 unexpired patents or other proprietary rights known to CONSULTANT, then 
 CONSULTANT agrees to disclose such circumstances to SEPRACOR and, upon 
 disclosure of such circumstance, CONSULTANT shall be under no obligation to 
 disclose further related information to SEPRACOR. 
 7.     NON-DISCLOSURE AND OTHER RESTRICTIONS 
        While serving as a CONSULTANT to SEPRACOR, CONSULTANT may obtain 
 knowledge or private information belonging to, or possessed or used by, SEPRACOR 
 and its business. This knowledge or information (the "PROPRIETARY INFORMATION") 
 may include, but is not limited to, knowledge or information in the form of 
 proprietary, confidential or trade secret processes, plans, materials, formulas, 
 and the like relating to SEPRACOR's business, products and other activities. 
        CONSULTANT agrees to treat such knowledge or information as confidential. 
        CONSULTANT agrees that he will not, without the prior written consent of 
 SEPRACOR, at any time during the term of this AGREEMENT or extension thereof as 
 provided in Section 1, and for a period of five (5) years after termination of 
 this AGREEMENT, directly or indirectly reveal, furnish or make known to any 
 person or use for CONSULTANT's benefit or the benefit of others any PROPRIETARY 
 INFORMATION of SEPRACOR, disclosed to, learned of, developed, or otherwise 
 acquired by CONSULTANT while performing services for SEPRACOR. CONSULTANT is 
 permitted to disclose the information obtained under the terms of this AGREEMENT 
 to third parties only on a need-to-know basis related to the performance of work 
 under this AGREEMENT, provided that SEPRACOR has approved the disclosure in 
 advance, and only if such persons are bound to protect the confidentiality of 
 such information to the same extent as the CONSULTANT pursuant to this 
 AGREEMENT. 
 
 
        This obligation is specifically qualified and limited by the 
 understanding that CONSULTANT will not have any obligation or liability of any 
 kind with respect to any PROPRIETARY INFORMATION which: 
        (a)    is generally known to the public at the time of disclosure or 
               becomes generally known through no wrongful act on the part of the 
               CONSULTANT; 
        (b)    becomes known to the CONSULTANT through disclosure by sources 
               other than SEPRACOR having the legal right to disclose such 
               PROPRIETARY INFORMATION; 
        (c)    has been independently developed by the CONSULTANT without 
               reference to or use of the PROPRIETARY INFORMATION; or 
        (d)    is required to be disclosed by the CONSULTANT to comply with 
               applicable laws or governmental regulations, PROVIDED THAT the 
               CONSULTANT provides prior written notice of such disclosure to 
               SEPRACOR and takes reasonable and lawful actions to avoid and/or 
               minimize the extent of such disclosure. 
 8.     PROPRIETARY PROPERTY 
        CONSULTANT agrees that all inventions, data, works, discoveries, designs, 
 technology and improvements, (whether or not protectable by a patent or a 
 copyright) ("INVENTIONS") related to the business of the SEPRACOR, which are 
 conceived of, made, reduced to practice, created, written, designed or 
 developed, authored or made by CONSULTANT, alone or in combination with others, 
 in the course of the performance of services under this AGREEMENT or thereafter 
 if resulting or directly derived from PROPRIETARY INFORMATION, shall be the sole 
 and exclusive property of SEPRACOR. The inventions are to be promptly reported 
 to SEPRACOR but otherwise maintained in confidence by CONSULTANT. All works 
 authored by the CONSULTANT under this AGREEMENT shall be deemed "works made for 
 hire" to the extent permitted by the copyright law. 
        CONSULTANT hereby assigns to SEPRACOR all INVENTIONS and any and all 
 related patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, and other industrial and 
 intellectual property rights and applications therefor, in the United States and 
 elsewhere, and appoints any officer of SEPRACOR as duly authorized agent to 
 execute, file, prosecute and protect the same before any government agency, 
 court or authority. 
        CONSULTANT agrees to cooperate fully with SEPRACOR and its nominees to 
 obtain patents or register copyrights in any and all countries for these 
 INVENTIONS, 
 
 
 and to execute all papers for use in applying for and obtaining such protection 
 thereon as SEPRACOR may desire, together with assignments thereof to confirm 
 SEPRACOR's ownership thereof, all at SEPRACOR's expense. 
        No rights are hereby given to SEPRACOR in any inventions conceived and 
 evidenced in an invention record or disclosure, or under any patents or patent 
 applications that CONSULTANT may own prior to the effective date of this 
 AGREEMENT or may subsequently acquire which do not arise out of the work 
 performed by CONSULTANT during the term of this AGREEMENT. 
 9.     TERMINATION 
        Either SEPRACOR or CONSULTANT may terminate this AGREEMENT upon seven (7) 
 days written notice to the other party. Such termination will be without 
 prejudice to any right or remedy either SEPRACOR or CONSULTANT might have as a 
 result of this AGREEMENT or due to a failure of the other to perform its 
 obligations under this AGREEMENT. 
        If this AGREEMENT is terminated by SEPRACOR, CONSULTANT shall be entitled 
 to full payment for all expenses already incurred and for performance of 
 consulting services prior to the date of termination, for which SEPRACOR is 
 obligated to pay as described in Section 3 of this AGREEMENT, subject to the 
 limitations on reimbursement of expenses paid or incurred prior to the effective 
 date of termination. Such payments shall constitute full settlement of any and 
 all claims of CONSULTANT of every description against SEPRACOR. Notwithstanding 
 the foregoing, SEPRACOR may terminate this AGREEMENT, effective immediately upon 
 receipt of written notice, if CONSULTANT breaches or threatens to breach any 
 provision of this AGREEMENT.

        Notices, and other communications required to be given hereunder shall be 
 deemed given when sent by either party by registered or certified mail to the
